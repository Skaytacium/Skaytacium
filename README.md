# Skaytacium

## Professional Professional.

### Skoding

- Tabs (4 spaces).
- CLI > GUI.
- Typescript, Python, C++, C# and most shell languages (Pwsh, Batch, Bash).
- Vim is good, VSCode Insiders with slow extensions is better.
- Windows can be used as a good development environment **without WSL**. But linux is better (I use void).
- Compile it yourselfâ„¢ movement. (I am not a Gentoo user, I use void)

### What I do

- Programming ~~if you can call it that~~.
- PCB Design.
- Basic to intermediate electronic engineering.
